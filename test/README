This folder contains files and suggestions related to testing the ClusterMouseAutism Shiny app.

Recommended tests include:

1) Filtering the heatmap separately by the 3 groups of strains identified in the study and the regions that were most affected for each individual group to verify that the data match what is stated in the paper.

2) Order the axis labels on the heatmap in the app to be the same order as Figure 3 in the paper, so the heatmaps can be compared side by side.

3) Repeat the following procedure:
- bootstrap the effect sizes
- find the median effect size for each strain * region combination
- plot heatmap and compare to original paper
- observe that the ordering of the strain dendrogram is quite stable, whereas the ordering of the region dendrogram jumps around quite a bit

4) Give option of plotting relative volumes as opposed to just absolute volumes
